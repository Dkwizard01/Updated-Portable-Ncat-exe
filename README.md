This is a portable exe version of Ncat. It is different from ncat-portable-5.59BETA1 in that it uses the latest version of Ncat (Ncat-7.95) and OpenSSL (Openssl-3.3.1) available at the time of compilation. It includes all the features of Ncat except a native PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library.
The exe was compiled using the guide found at the Nmap/Ncat project wiki (minus some slight modifications):
https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap/Ncat_Portable
To use the exe, navigate to the directory where it is located and then just type: "ncat.exe" followed by standard Ncat commands.
